# King of the Lunch API


## About

This repository is a part of a _show off_ project named "**King of the Lunch**"
("Rei do Lanche" em PortuguÃªs).

Every day there will be an election for applicants for the title "King of the Lunch". Such an election is open for voting between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm. Then at 12:01 pm the votes are counted, and a new King is elected (although one can be elected King more than once).

A given applicant must apply for the elections by registering his **name** and **e-mail** (only one applicant per e-mail is permitted).

### Future features

* Configure application if it should open voting in now work days.
* Ask for some id (email, Facebook id,...) to prevent the same user to vote more than once.

## Setting up

As previously mentioned, this project is part of major project called "**King of the Lunch**". Please take a look at docker project : [Docker Infrastructure](https://github.com/fabricioyukio/kotl-docker) before you start.

Also check [Web](https://github.com/fabricioyukio/kotl-web) - A ReactJS app to work as a GUI/Frontend for this API.

### With or without Docker Infrastructure?

The "Docker Infrastructure" project have been made as a way of providing a development environment in order to standardize the process of developing independent of your current OS and provide a quick '*hands-on*' on coding!

Without the "Docker Infrastructure" project, you have to provide all the required dependencies (php 7.2, Laravel 6, Redis, MySQL, etc...) in order to make it happen.

#### With Docker Infrastructure

In your favorite shell (iterm, zsh, git-gui,...) just prefix all commands with "**docker exec api -it {your_command}**". Example:

```bash
composer install
```

You should do as:

```bash
# it might appear a little more cumbersome, but you might just run commands
# from any available shell window
docker exec api -it composer install
```

#### Without Docker Infrastructure

You will need to navigate to within **application directory** in the server instance (VM, Remote server, Vagrant Machine) order to run commands. 

### Getting started

#### Vendor modules

Get required vendor modules with composer:

```bash
composer install
```

#### Set env file and application key

First of all you must make an ***.env*** file, by copying **.env.example** file:

```bash
# copy file
cp .env.example .env
# generate key
php artisan key:generate
```

Then edit the newly created **.env** file, adjusting parameters where needed.

```ini
# /.env
APP_NAME=kotl-api
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=SOME_HASH_CREATED
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

LOG_CHANNEL=stack

DB_CONNECTION=mysql

```

##### Macte animo!

You are almost there!

#### Run migrations and seeds

```bash
# migrations to create tables
php artisan migrate
# seeds to initial population of seeds
php artisan db:seed
```

##### Reseting DB

You might be running experimentations with the DB, it might get some inconsistencies. Whenever it happens I would recommend you to reset database*.

Anyways. Should ever need to reset the database run:
```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
```

> Remember that it's not a production ready project, nor a state of art boilerplate...
